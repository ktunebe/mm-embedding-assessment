# <Multimedia and Embedding Assessment>

## This is a test run of the MDN assessment on embedding pictures and frames into HTML for different viewport sizes.

- This was deployed so that the author could test the HTML on different browsers, including a mobile browser.
- It enables the user to see the change in photo sizes as the viewport size changes.
- I learned that I was able to achieve a functional result.
